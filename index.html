    <p class="w3-justify">
      I started playing piano when I was about 9 years old. I remember my mother signing me up for piano lessons at Cristofori, a music school near my place.
      At that point in time I was learning just because my parents thought it would be good for me to do so.
      However I started getting bored of it and i eventually stopped learning when I was Secondary 2.
      At that point in time I just finished my ABRSM grade 5 exam.
      From Secondary 2 to 3 was when I first started playing the piano out of my own enjoyment.
      I learnt different pop songs and I remember my first song was a Korean song from A Kdrama I watched.
      Eventually, I decided I wanted to continue learning the piano classically as I felt the technical skills I could learn would help me learn the songs I like better.
      Hence, I picked up the piano again when I was in Secondary 3 and finished my ABRSM grade 8 exam when I was 18 in J2. 
      My love for playing the piano has only increased, and I have since joined my hall Jam Band! Click on the Navigation bar above to see our band and some of our performances!
